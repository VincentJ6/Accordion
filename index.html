                Modern English is written with a Latin-script alphabet consisting of 26 letters, with each having both uppercase and lowercase forms.
                 The word alphabet is a compound of alpha and beta, the names of the first two letters in the Greek alphabet. 
                 Old English was first written down using the Latin alphabet during the 7th century. 
                 During the centuries that followed,
                 various letters entered or fell out of use. By the 16th century, the present set of 26 letters had largely stabilised:
